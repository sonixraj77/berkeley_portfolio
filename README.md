The data suggests that:
- Bar coupons were accepted by about 16% of drivers.
- Drivers who went to a bar less than 3 times a month were more likely to accept the bar coupon than those who went more than 3 times a month.
- Drivers who were over the age of 25 and went to a bar more than once a month were more likely to accept the bar coupon than those who were under the age of 25 or went to a bar less than once a month.
- Drivers who went to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not kids were more likely to accept the bar coupon than those who had kids as passengers.
- Drivers who went to bars more than once a month and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry were more likely to accept the bar coupon than those who had occupations in those fields.
- Drivers who went to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and had incomes less than $50,000 were more likely to accept the bar coupon than those who went to cheap restaurants less than 4 times a month or had incomes greater than $50,000.

Based on these observations, we can hypothesize that drivers who accepted the bar coupons were more likely to be:
- Male
- Over the age of 25
- Had passengers that were not kids/only adults
- Had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry
- Went to bars more than once a month
- Had incomes less than $50,000
- Went to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month

These drivers may have been more likely to accept the bar coupons because they were more likely to be interested in going to bars and because they were more likely to be able to afford to go to bars.
